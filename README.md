**Continual Learning Bench** measures how well AI agents learn from past environment interactions, the defining challenge for agents that operate over extended horizons and are expected to improve online.

## Quickstart

Continual Learning Bench requires Python 3.13 or later, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), and a local Docker installation for tasks and systems that run containerized workspaces.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pgasawa/continual-learning-bench && cd continual-learning-bench
uv sync --all-extras && source .venv/bin/activate
pre-commit install
clbench setup --all
```

Add any model provider keys you need to a `.env` file in the project root, then verify the CLI and run a small benchmark:

```bash
clbench list
clbench run exploitable_poker --schedule quick_test --system icl
```

### Routing through an OpenAI-compatible proxy

If your provider is fronted by a custom OpenAI-compatible gateway that authenticates with a non-standard `X-API-Key` header (in addition to the bearer token), set both keys plus the base URL in `.env`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-proxy.example.com/v1
X_API_KEY=...
```

`src/vendors/oai_proxy.py` is wired into `src/cli.py` and runs after `load_dotenv()`, transparently injecting `X-API-Key` into every `litellm.completion / acompletion / responses / aresponses` call. No system-side changes are required.

If your proxy fronts an Azure OpenAI deployment that gates the Responses API on an `api-version` query string the proxy doesn't forward, run icl in chat-completions mode:

```bash
clbench run --config configs/exploitable_poker/exploitable_poker_icl.json \
  --system-params '{"provider_mode":"litellm_chat"}' \
  --no-live-dashboard
```

The [Quickstart Guide](https://continual-learning-bench.com/docs/quickstart/) walks through the same flow in more detail, including how to inspect tasks, systems, schedules, and run outputs.

## Core Components

### Dataset of Tasks

Each task spans multiple episodes in a shared environment, so agents that remember feedback and adapt should outperform those that solve each instance from scratch. Tasks include:

- a set of constructed task instances with a learnable structure,
- an evaluation script and reward metric measuring improvement over episodes,
- schedules and variants for repeatable comparisons across systems.

Tasks live in `src/tasks/`. See the [Task Gallery](https://continual-learning-bench.com/tasks.html) for an overview that's easy to browse.

### Systems

Systems are the agents evaluated by the benchmark. Built-in baselines and model-backed systems live in `src/systems/`, and custom systems can be added to test new memory, retrieval, prompting, or tool-use strategies.

### Execution Harness

The harness connects systems to task environments, manages multi-episode rollouts, records traces, and writes viewer artifacts for analysis. After installing, explore available options with:

```bash
clbench run --help
clbench run-all --help
```
